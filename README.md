## My name is Eric

I am working toward becoming a full stack developer. As of July 2021 I believe I am at least half way there. 

I am currently working on: 

- strengthening a few weak points in my front end skillset 
- learning git on a deeper level and actively incorporating its use in my projects.
- learning php and mysql
    - I have several active php projects going at the moment
- learning markdown
- learning OOP with php 
- revisiting CSS concepts that I do not fully grasp (even though I can use them)
