## My name is Eric

I am working toward becoming a full stack developer. As of July 2021 I believe I am at least half way there. 

I am currently working on: 

- strengthening a few weak points in my front end skillset 
- learning git on a deeper level and actively incorporating its use in my projects.
- learning php and mysql
    - I have several active php projects going at the moment
- learning markdown
- learning OOP with php 
- revisiting CSS concepts that I do not fully grasp (even though I can use them)

This week I discovered [Dev.to](https://dev.to/eherod). I intend to begin making tutorial blogs on this site immediately as a way to help my developer skills grow. I might turn these blogs into video content as well. I expect this github README to change constantly in the next couple weeks as I begin to add projects to my portfolio and begin producing web dev related content.


I am looking for any type of collaborative project, even if it is only a practice project. I just want the experience.

You can reach me at <ericjherod@gmail.com>
